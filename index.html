    Like mankind, nature can have its bright side and its dark side.
    <br>That beautiful meadow in a sunny day had given way to a violent thunderstorm tonight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Weak, soaked clothes, face in the mud, barely conscious, and completely alone... under the unrelenting rain, there was a boy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nobody knew him, nobody knew he was there, nobody even knew he existed.
    <br>Not even him, in fact. All he knew was confusion, tiredness, powerlessness...
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon, he passed out.
    <br>That's all what destiny had in it for him, for now.

    The night dragged on, and as if the enraged weather let off enough steam to return to its calm, peaceful self, what followed was the typical sunny daybreak in the meadow.
